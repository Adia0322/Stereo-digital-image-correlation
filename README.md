Stereo Digital Image Correlation (SDIC) is a non-contact optical measurement technique used to analyze deformation and strain in materials. It employs a pair of cameras to capture images of an object's surface from different angles. By correlating the images, it determines displacement and deformation fields with high accuracy. SDIC finds applications in various fields like mechanical engineering, civil engineering, and biomechanics, offering valuable insights into material behavior under different conditions. Its non-invasive nature and precise measurements make it a valuable tool for research and quality control in industries.

Example:
Execute STEP4 to calculate the displacement field of the 5*5 array.
